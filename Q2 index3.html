	<p style="color: white; text-align: center;" >Coraline is about a girl with blue hair who recently just moved to "Pink Palace Apartments", a house shared and split by many. With her "boring" workaholic parents, she was forced to spend time alone and explore the house, making her discover a small door by their living room. At first, the small door was blocked when opened. But, at night, the small door led to the other world. The other world was just like their world, but "better". There she meets her "other mother" who looked and talked just like her mom but with buttons for eyes. From then on she started spending her nights there, until things took a very dark turn.</p>
